Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification using Logistic Regression
üìÑ Overview
This project involves classifying objects as either Rock or Mine using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset contains sonar signal attributes to distinguish between the two classes. The primary objective is to build a predictive system with high accuracy for real-world application in sonar signal classification.

üõ†Ô∏è Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset (sonar_data.csv) and analyzed its structure.
Checked for missing values (none were found).
Dataset contained 208 samples and 61 columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Described the dataset using statistical summaries (df.describe()).
Examined class distribution:
111 Mine samples (M).
97 Rock samples (R).
Feature Engineering:

Dropped the target column (60) from features.
Split the dataset into:
Features (X) and Target (y).
Applied stratified splitting to balance the classes during training and testing.
Model Training:

Split data into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets.
Trained a Logistic Regression model using sklearn.
Achieved:
Training Accuracy: 83.42%.
Testing Accuracy: 76.19%.
Prediction System:

Built a prediction pipeline to classify new sonar signals based on input data.
Example Input: (0.0262, 0.0582, ..., 0.6473)
Output Prediction: ['M'] (Mine).
üß∞ Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
numpy for numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.
üìä Results
Training Set:
Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 83.42%.
Test Set:
Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of 76.19%.
